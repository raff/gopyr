# pygor
Python to Go Regurgitator

    Dr. Frederick Frankenstein: You must be Igor. [he pronounces it ee-gor.]
    Igor: No, it's pronounced "eye-gor."

A Python 3 to Go transpiler, with many things to be desired.

Note that the parser is currently targeted to Python 3.4 so some latest Python 3 additions are not supported (yet)
and are reported as parsing errors.

## installation

    go get -v -u github.com/raff/pygor
    
## usage

    go run pygor.go python_code.py
    
    Usage of pygor:
      -d int
            Parser debug level 0-4
      -lines
            add source line numbers
      -main
            generate a runnable application (main package)
      -panic
            panic on unknown expression, to get a stacktrace
      -verbose
            print statement and expressions

## tests

    for f in tests/*.py
    do
      go run pygor.go $f
    done

## example

### original
    def test():
        a = 1
        if a < 5:
            return a + 5
        return a - 5

    def one():
        n = 5

        def two():
            print(n + 3)

        print(two())

### converted
    // generated by pygor
    package def

    import "fmt"

    func test() {
            var a = 1
            if a < 5 {
                    return a + 5
            }
            return a - 5
    } 

    func one() {
            var n = 5
            two := func() {
                    fmt.Println(n + 3)
            }

            fmt.Println(two())
    }
