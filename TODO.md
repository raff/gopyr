# This that could be done

- Convert "string".join(list) to strings.Join(list, "string")

- isinstance(v, (t1, t2, t3))

- int(s, base) - but int() can also be int(string, base=10) or int(number)

- for x,y,z in list_of_tuples: this could be converted to for _t := range _list_of tuples { x,y,z = _t; ... }
